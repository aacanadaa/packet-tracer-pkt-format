## Install

```console
$ pip install packet-tracer-pkt-format
```

Python 3.10 or newer. The only runtime dependency is `pydantic`. Reading,
inspecting, diffing, exporting and re-writing files needs nothing else — no Packet
Tracer, no compiler, no system crypto library. `libgcrypt`, if present, and the
optional Rust extension are picked up automatically as accelerators; the pure-Python
ciphers are always available as the reference path.

## Quickstart

Point it at any `.pkt` or `.pka` you already have:

```console
$ pkt info my_lab.pkt                          # container metadata, size, root tag
$ pkt export my_lab.pkt --format graphviz -o topology.dot
$ pkt unpack my_lab.pkt -o out/                # XML + per-device IOS configs + topology
$ pkt pack out/my_lab.xml -o rebuilt.pkt       # byte-exact reconstruction
```

```python
from pkt_core import decode
from pkt_core.models import Lab

lab = Lab.from_bytes(decode("my_lab.pkt").xml)
print(len(lab.devices), "devices,", len(lab.links), "links")
for dev in lab.devices:
    print(dev.name, dev.kind, dev.model)
```

## Create a Packet Tracer, without Packet Tracer

Packet Tracer is only needed to *open* the result — the lab itself is authored here.
The `Lab` builder ships with the package, templates included, so this works after a
plain `pip install` with no checkout:

```python
from pkt_core import Lab

lab = Lab()                       # bundled seed document and 137-device template library
lab.prune_seed_devices()          # start from a clean canvas
r  = lab.add_device("2911", "R1", 250, 350, install="HWIC-2T",
                    ios_config=["interface GigabitEthernet0/0",
                                " ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0", " no shutdown", "end"])
sw = lab.add_device("2960-24TT", "SW1", 450, 350)
pc = lab.add_device("PC-PT", "PC1", 650, 350,
                    pc_ip=("192.168.1.10", "255.255.255.0", "192.168.1.1"))
lab.link(r, "GigabitEthernet0/0", sw, "GigabitEthernet0/1")
lab.link(sw, "FastEthernet0/1", pc, "FastEthernet0")
lab.save("my_lab.pkt")            # open in Packet Tracer — no Packet Tracer used to build it
```

...or one-shot from a topology spec (devices + links → a scored, password-protected
activity). These generators live in [`tools/`](tools) and run from a checkout:

```console
$ python3 tools/make_scored_lab.py --out mylab.pka --spec topology.json --password hunter2
```

---


Modern Packet Tracer files have **no magic header** and are fully encrypted, so
`file`, `strings`, and hex dumps show nothing but noise.  This project documents
the container and ships a small reader that turns a `.pkt`/`.pka` back into the
plain XML Packet Tracer stores internally.

## TL;DR

```
.pkt  ..  [ scramble ] -> [ Twofish-EAX, key=0x89*16, iv=0x10*16 ] ->
          [ XOR (len-i) ] -> [ qCompress/zlib ] -> "<?xml ... <PACKETTRACER5>"
```

* Cipher: **Twofish in EAX (AEAD) mode**, 128-bit key = `0x89` repeated, IV =
  `0x10` repeated, 16-byte tag appended.
* Pre-encryption wrapper: byte reversal + position XOR.
* Post-decryption wrapper: XOR every byte with `(len - i)`.
* Payload: Qt `qCompress` (zlib) of a UTF-8 XML document.

Full details, evidence and the per-format key table are in **[FORMAT.md](FORMAT.md)**.

## The `pkt_core` library

`pt9.py` is a self-contained reference codec. Alongside it, `src/pkt_core/` is the
**type-safe library** (Python 3.10+) intended for embedding — the CLI is a thin
consumer of it and is never imported back into the package. Everything is checked
under `mypy --strict` except `pkt_core.builder`, which is a port of the authoring
code and is not yet annotated internally; its public signatures are typed.

```python
from pkt_core import decode, encode_bytes

container = decode("lab.pkt")          # format is detected by the AEAD tag,
                                       # not by a magic prefix — there isn't one
print(container.root_tag)              # 'PACKETTRACER5'
print(container.is_activity)           # False  (.pka -> PACKETTRACER5_ACTIVITY)
xml = container.xml                    # the inner XML document

rebuilt = encode_bytes(xml, container.format_name)
```

```python
from pkt_core import decode
from pkt_core.models import Lab

lab = Lab.from_bytes(decode("lab.pkt").xml)
for dev in lab.devices:
    print(dev.name, dev.kind, dev.model, dev.position)
for link in lab.links:
    print(link.port_names, link.cable_type)
```

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `pkt_core.crypto.primitives` | CMAC (RFC 4493), big-endian CTR, and the Crypto++ EAX variant |
| `pkt_core.crypto.keys` | Per-format key schedule (`twofish`/`serpent128`/`cast256`, key & IV bytes) |
| `pkt_core.crypto.stream` | The two positional-XOR obfuscation layers |
| `pkt_core.crypto.ciphers_pure` | Pure-Python Twofish, Serpent and CAST-256 |
| `pkt_core.codec.qcompress` | Qt `qCompress` framing |
| `pkt_core.codec.container` | Detect / decode / encode the whole container |
| `pkt_core.xml` | Lossless byte-level XML layer (lazy, HTML-tolerant) |
| `pkt_core.models` | Typed views: `Lab`, `Device`, `Port`, `Link`, `Cluster`, `RunningConfig` |
| `pkt_core.builder` | Authoring: `Lab` (place, power, module, cable, configure), `Layout` |
| `pkt_core.resources` | The bundled template library and seed document |
| `pkt_core.diff` | Semantic device/link/config comparison |
| `pkt_core.export` | `graphviz`, `netbox`, `containerlab` topology export |
| `pkt_core.errors` | Typed exceptions — never a bare `Exception` |

The models are **views over the lossless XML tree**, not a parallel data
structure: writing a document out again emits the original source bytes for
anything you did not touch, so data loss is impossible by construction.
Unrecognised elements are surfaced in each model's ``extra_fields`` rather than
dropped. IOS ``<LINE>`` config is exposed as ``bytes`` on purpose — it carries
raw ``^C`` banner delimiters that decoding would normalise away.

The AEAD is **deterministic**: key and IV are fixed per format, so the keystream
is file-independent and identical XML always produces identical bytes. That is
also what makes the EAX tag usable as a format-detection oracle (false-positive
rate 2^-128) instead of a magic number.

Sample containers generated by this project are committed under
[`corpus/samples/`](corpus/samples/) so the tests run out of the box. The 1,026
third-party files used for the reverse engineering are **not** committed — see
[`corpus/README.md`](corpus/README.md) for the policy and
[`corpus/fetch_corpus.py`](corpus/fetch_corpus.py) to reproduce them.

## Usage

`pt9.py` is the original single-file reader/writer and needs no install; `pkt` is
the full CLI. Neither requires `libgcrypt` — install it (`apt install libgcrypt20`)
only if you want the accelerated cipher path.

```console
$ python3 pt9.py info   my_lab.pkt
root tag  : PACKETTRACER5
xml bytes : 1045755

$ python3 pt9.py decode my_lab.pkt -o my_lab.xml
$ python3 pt9.py decode course_activity.pka -o activity.xml      # .pka uses the same container
$ python3 pt9.py encode my_lab.xml -o my_lab.pkt                 # write it back
$ python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v                       # self-tests
```

The `pkt` entry point adds inspection, diffing, export and auditing:

```console
$ pkt info    my_lab.pkt                 # container metadata, size, root tag
$ pkt unpack  my_lab.pkt -o out/         # XML + per-device IOS configs + topology
$ pkt pack    out/my_lab.xml -o rebuilt.pkt   # byte-exact reconstruction
$ pkt diff    before.pkt after.pkt       # structural diff
$ pkt export  my_lab.pkt --format graphviz    # graphviz / netbox / containerlab
$ pkt audit   my_lab.pkt --templates tools/device_templates.json
```

### `pkt audit` — why it exists

A count is only meaningful if the counted things are **distinct**. Early
versions of this toolkit shipped a 290-device model whose service totals were
inflated by template leftovers — 202 "AAA clients" of which only 140 were
distinct (the other 63 were one phantom `192.168.10.1` copied off a harvested
device template onto every device), and 259 "DHCP pools" of which 131 were
distinct. The validator asserted *presence*, so it printed `PASSED (0 warnings)`
while reporting both wrong numbers.

`pkt audit` prints raw **and** distinct counts for every service family, flags
records that came from a harvested template rather than from the author, and
**exits non-zero** on any duplicate. Real output for the enterprise model *before*
it was sanitised:

```console
$ pkt audit JASDF_AEWC_JADGE.pkt --templates tools/device_templates.json
device_names: 290 raw, 290 distinct
config lines  : min=78 median=143 max=250 total=22,648 (143 IOS/ASA devices,
                by model); 22,896 <LINE> elements in 205 RUNNINGCONFIG blocks
services      : 496 DNS records (248 distinct x 2 servers)
  aaa_clients: 202 raw, 140 distinct, 62 duplicate instances
               (e.g. 192.168.10.1 x63), 63 template leftovers -> 139 authored
  dhcp_pools : 259 raw, 133 distinct, 126 duplicate instances
               (e.g. serverPool / 0.0.0.0 / 0.0.0.0 x65), 128 template leftovers
  aaa_users  :  65 raw,   3 distinct, 62 duplicate instances (e.g. user x63)
  ftp_accounts: 64 raw,   3 distinct, 61 duplicate instances (e.g. cisco x62)
  FAIL duplicate-dhcp-pool-name: pool name 'serverPool' is used by 128 pools
  FAIL duplicate-dhcp-pool-name: pool name 'IRUMA-VLAN10' is used by 2 pools
  ...
RESULT: FAILED (15 failures, 0 warnings)
```

Note the config-line row: it prints **both** figures, with the method for each
(IOS/ASA devices selected by model, versus raw `<LINE>` elements in all 205
blocks). The earlier documentation published one number without its method,
which made it unreproducible. The numbers have since moved once — from
22,579/22,827 to 22,648/22,896 — when a device that was shipping a harvested
template's factory-default config was found and properly configured. That is
the point of printing the method: the figure is checkable, so it can be seen
to change for a reason.

The rule this encodes, and which the library now follows everywhere: **if a
validator prints a count, it must prove those items are distinct.**

Example decrypted root elements:

```
<PACKETTRACER5>
  <VERSION>9.0.1.0858</VERSION>
  <PIXMAPBANK>…</PIXMAPBANK>
  <DEVICES>…</DEVICES>
  <LINKS>…</LINKS>
  …
```

## Status / scope

**Both container families are fully decoded, both directions.**
`encode(decode(f)) == f` **byte-for-byte on 1058 of 1058 real containers** — see
[`docs/CORPUS_VERIFICATION.md`](docs/CORPUS_VERIFICATION.md).

| Family | Written by | Transform | Files verified |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **modern** | PT **5.3.3** → 9.0.1 | layer A → Crypto++ EAX (Twofish) → layer B → qCompress | 865 |
| **legacy** | PT **4.1** → 5.3.2 | layer B → qCompress *(no AEAD, no reversal)* | 193 |

* The AEAD authentication tag is reproduced exactly and verified on load.
* Verified against **Packet Tracer 9.0.1.0858** (Linux x86-64) and 1,058 real
  files spanning **PT 4.1 through PT 9.0.1**.
* **Neither family has a magic header.** Detection is verifier-based: the EAX tag
  for the modern family (false-positive rate 2⁻¹²⁸), a structural qCompress probe
  for the legacy one. The container switchover is exactly 5.3.2 → 5.3.3.
* Documents are **not always well-formed XML** — `<LINE>` config text carries raw
  control bytes (the Cisco `banner motd ^C…^C` delimiter is a literal `\x03`) and
  PT 4.1 documents end with a trailing NUL. Do not use a validating parser.
* Three root elements exist: `PACKETTRACER5`, `PACKETTRACER5_ACTIVITY` and
  `PACKETTRACER_ACTIVITY` (PT 4.x). Root element is **not** a container
  discriminator.
* `.pkt`/`.pka` are fully supported. The `.pta`/`.pkc` (Serpent) and internal
  `sm`/`userapp` (CAST-256) flavours are specified but need a crypto backend
  with Serpent/CAST-256 (stock `libgcrypt` has neither).

## How it was found

Static analysis of the fully-symbolized `PacketTracer` binary located
`CNetworkFile::openFile`, the `Util::encrypt*/decrypt*` family, the generic
`Util::cipher/decipher<Cipher>` templates, and Crypto++'s `EAX_Base` /
`AuthenticatedDecryptionFilter`.  Packet Tracer was then run headless under
`Xvfb` with `gdb` breakpoints to capture the exact ciphertext and plaintext,
which pinned the CTR counter and both obfuscation layers with byte-accurate
certainty.

## Generating files

Because encoding is byte-exact, the same codec **writes** `.pkt` files.  Tools in
[`tools/`](tools) and notes in [`docs/SCENE_GRAPH.md`](docs/SCENE_GRAPH.md):

### At enterprise scale

[`large-scale-packet-tracer`](https://github.com/aacanadaa/large-scale-packet-tracer)
holds two full networks generated this way and verified to open in Packet Tracer
9.0.1 — the models in the screenshot above:

| Network | Devices | Links | Config lines | Size |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Y-AMLT (Yokohama maritime terminal) | 386 | 380 | 15,345 | 1.33 MB |
| IRUMA-AB (JASDF air base) | 392 | 372 | 13,728 | 1.40 MB |

Each ships three profiles (enterprise / standard / smoke) so you can iterate without
opening a 392-device canvas. That repository is also where the large-topology
findings that became the [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) rules were worked out.

A worked, six-device walkthrough — build, open, OSPF convergence, ping across two
routers — is [`demo/build_demo.py`](demo/build_demo.py): `pip install
packet-tracer-pkt-format`, run it, open the file it writes. The reference material
(format specification, schema, scene graph, verification reports) lives on the
[docs site](https://aacanadaa.github.io/packet-tracer-pkt-format/) so this file stays
a reference.

* `tools/harvest_merge.py` — harvest one complete device of every model from a
  tree of existing `.pkt` files and merge them into one canvas, handling the
  physical-workspace remapping PT requires.
* `tools/build_wired_lab.py` — the same, **plus auto-wiring**: cables every
  ethernet-capable device to a backbone of core switches and chains the cores.
* `tools/build_configured_lab.py` — a full **working, configured** lab
  (`PC1－SW1－R1＝R2－SW2－PC2` with IPs, gateways, static routes, and an optional
  long running-config).  IOS config is written as `<RUNNINGCONFIG><LINE>…`
  commands and applied on load; PCs get `<IP>/<SUBNET>/<PORT_GATEWAY>`.  See
  [`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`](docs/CONFIGURATION.md).
* `tools/activity.py` + `tools/scoring.py` — author **activity files (`.pka`)** with the Activity Wizard: instructions (HTML), the **activity-wizard password**, permissions, feedback, the **initial / answer networks**, and the **scoring tree**.  See [`docs/ACTIVITY.md`](docs/ACTIVITY.md).
* `tools/make_scored_lab.py` — **one-shot offline generator**: from a topology spec (`--spec`) it builds the initial + answer networks, derives scoring, and writes a scored `.pka`.  No Packet Tracer needed.  Ships with a library of **137 device templates, 75 module templates and 14 scoring shapes** (`tools/device_templates.json`, `tools/device_shapes.json`).
* `tools/harvest_library.py` — (re)build those libraries from your own `.pkt`/`.pka` files to extend model/shape coverage.
* `tools/lab_api.py` — a small library of the **verified authoring operations**
  (place device, power on/off, install a module, cable copper, write IOS
  `RUNNINGCONFIG`, set PC IP/DHCP).  Capability matrix + details in
  [`docs/CAPABILITIES.md`](docs/CAPABILITIES.md).
* Editing: decode → change device names/config/positions → encode → PT opens it.

Result of running the wired builder here: **147 devices, 140 distinct models,
71 cables** (routers, switches, ASAs, WLCs, APs, IP phones, PCs/laptops/tablets,
servers, and a large IoT/industrial set) in one file that Packet Tracer opens
and draws connected.

Key facts for anyone generating files (details in the scene-graph notes):

* Devices carry a *physical scene* placement that must be remapped when merging.
* A cable binds by `<FROM>`/`<TO>` ids and `<PORT>` names; the device needs an
  `<ENGINE>/<SAVE_REF_ID>` and the port must exist on that exact instance.  The
  `*_MEM_ADDR` fields are not validated — PT rebinds.

## Legal / ethical

* Interoperability research on a file format, using a locally licensed copy of
  Packet Tracer and the author's own files.
* No DRM or licence protection is bypassed; there is no encryption password.
* Intended for reading *your own* files, format documentation, tooling and
  archival.
* **Do not** use this to obtain, alter, or submit assessment/competition answer
  keys.  That is cheating and is out of scope.
